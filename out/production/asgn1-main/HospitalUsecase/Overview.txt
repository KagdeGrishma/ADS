Using : Priority Queue 
----------------------
A priority queue is an abstract data type that stores elements with priorities and provides operations to access the elements based 
on their priority. The elements with higher priority are given priority over the elements with lower priority.
The priority queue can be implemented in different ways such as a min heap, max heap, or a binary search tree.

Real world scenario :
---------------------
Imagine you are working at a hospital and need to keep track of patients with various medical conditions. 
Some patients require immediate attention, while others can wait. 
You can use a priority queue to prioritize which patients to attend to first based on their urgency level.

So here, 
In the hospital triage system, patients are prioritized based on their urgency level and the availability of doctors. 
The priority queue class is used to manage the order of treatment for patients. 
The priority queue class has several methods to manage the queue of patients, such as adding a new patient, treating the next patient, 
getting the total treatment time for all patients in the queue, getting the number of patients in the queue, 
and updating the urgency level of a patient.

The Patient class implements the Comparable interface, which allows the patients to be compared based on their urgency level 
and doctor availability. The Patient class contains information about the patient's name, urgency level, treatment time, and doctor ID.
The compareTo method of the Patient class is used to compare the urgency level of patients. If two patients have the same urgency level,
they are compared based on the availability of the doctor. The higher the urgency level, the higher the priority for treatment. 
The lower the doctor ID, the higher the priority for treatment.

The PriorityQueue class uses an ArrayList to store the patients in the queue. The addPatient method is used to add a new patient to 
the queue. The treatPatient method is used to remove the next patient from the queue and treat them. The getTotalTreatmentTime method 
returns the total treatment time for all patients in the queue. The getPatientCount method returns the number of patients in the queue. 
The updatePatientPriority method is used to update the urgency level of a patient in the queue.

The goal of this implementation is to create a priority queue for a hospital triage system that prioritizes the treatment of patients
 based on their urgency level and doctor availability, and allows for efficient management of the queue of patients.
